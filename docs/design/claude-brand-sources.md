# Claude brand sources and reuse inventory

> Source research and initial reuse inventory from 6–7 October, published with the redesign in PR #15. References were checked on those dates; this cleanup did not re-fetch logo or programme sources. Earlier review boundaries and asset mappings are historical. See the [release ledger](../README.md#release-ledger) and [current design contract](../../DESIGN.md). Checks and screenshots below apply to their recorded version; this cleanup did not repeat browser QA.

Verified on 6 October 2026 for the local design playground.

## Official color source

Anthropic publishes its official styling colors in the [brand-guidelines source](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md):

| Token | Value | Playground use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orange | `#D97757` | Primary brand accent, filled CTAs and visual details |
| Light | `#FAF9F5` | Warm page canvas |
| Dark | `#141413` | Primary text and dark sections |
| Light gray | `#E8E6DC` | Card and illustration surfaces |
| Mid gray | `#B0AEA5` | Decorative rules and non-text details |
| Blue | `#6A9BCC` | Reserved secondary accent |
| Green | `#788C5D` | Reserved tertiary accent |

Readable secondary text uses a darker neutral than the official mid-gray swatch. Orange text on cream can be too low-contrast, so headlines and small text stay dark; orange appears as a background or decorative accent. The palette is verified from the official source; the composition and local font choices are this club's design proposal, not an official Claude site template.

## Official Claude logo

- Source: [Claude's official website](https://claude.com/), navigation wordmark SVG, `aria-label="Claude"`, `viewBox="0 0 573 125"`.
- Saved locally as `images/brand/claude-official.svg` from the SVG delivered by the official website.
- Preserve the full mark, path geometry, proportions, wordmark and orange `#D97757` symbol. Do not generate, redraw, tint, crop, animate or distort the partner logo.
- Display separately from the club's own logo, with clear spacing and an explicit collaboration label; do not fabricate a combined logo.
- Anthropic also identifies its [Brandfolder](https://brandfolder.com/anthropic) as a source for official assets. The public [Newsroom collection](https://brandfolder.com/anthropic/newsroom) was inspected; it currently exposes illustrations, while the official website supplies the Claude wordmark used here.

## Existing assets reused without modification

- `images/logo/cam-ai-builder-logo.png`: existing club desktop wordmark.
- `images/logo/cam-ai-builder-logo-mobile.png`: existing square club mark for mobile and the community block.
- `images/illustrations/ai-builder.png`: existing homepage illustration.
- `images/features/noun_branding_1885335.svg`: Demo card.
- `images/features/noun_The Process_1885341.svg`: Workshop card.
- `images/features/noun_3d modeling_1885342.svg`: Hackathon card.
- Existing public member portraits remain sourced from `_team/`.

The user identifies this society as a Claude Builder Club collaborating with Claude. The playground states that context. Legacy route content and historical source records remain unchanged until the later content migration review.

## Generation policy for this design

No new images were generated for this revision. The earlier metallic-loop experiment is retained as an unused historical concept file; it is not referenced by the playground. Inventory and reuse come first. Only consider new generation for an identified need the current files cannot cover. Partner logos always come from the official publisher.

## Review workflow

Design exploration is local, per the user's correction. Draft PR #15 was closed and detached. These iterations are not committed, pushed or submitted as another PR. The next checkpoint is the local playground review; production migration remains a separate later phase.

## Approved migration update

The owner approved the direction and requested redesign of the three activity illustrations. Their new SVG files and authorship are documented in [activity artwork](activity-artwork.md); the initial reused-icon inventory above records the earlier preview. Club marks, hero art, portraits and the official Claude wordmark remain unchanged. See [migration verification](migration-qa.md) for the completed local rollout.

## Final identity and publication update

The website name is Cambridge AI Builder Club, as confirmed by the owner on 7 October 2026. Claude remains the collaboration partner and the official palette and logo sources are unchanged. The owner subsequently requested reopening, updating and merging PR #15 after local review.
