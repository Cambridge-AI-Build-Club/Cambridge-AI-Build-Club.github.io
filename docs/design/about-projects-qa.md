# About and Projects verification

> Historical QA from 10 October, published in PR #23 after owner approval. The plan/local-review publication boundaries below describe earlier checkpoints. See the [release ledger](../README.md#release-ledger) and [current design contract](../../DESIGN.md). Checks and screenshots below apply to their recorded version; this cleanup did not repeat browser QA.

Verified locally on 10 October 2026. Branch: `feature/about-projects`. Local preview: http://localhost:4102/. Awaiting the owner's preview review; not deployed.

The shared header now includes About and Projects, with the menu at widths of 1100px and below. About introduces CBC World; Projects features its captured live screenshot, description, capabilities and live/source links. Both previews read one project record from `_data/projects.yml`. The original About introduction is retained, followed by researched context about the wider builder community and the role of Claude Campus Ambassadors. A transition explains why we built CBC World before its preview. Projects has a matching introduction.

## Campus background and transition revision

Research preceded the copy plan and implementation. [Anthropic's official campus programme](https://claude.com/programs/campus) explains the Claude Builder Club and Claude Campus Ambassador roles. The club's [launch article](../../_blogs/claude-builder-program.md) documents its programme collaboration. The new About section links directly to the official programme. Historical event forecasts, recruitment terms and programme benefits are omitted.

The static build and design policy passed again after this copy revision. The eight About/Projects screenshots below were refreshed at 1440px/375px in both themes; eight fresh axe scans found zero violations or incomplete findings. The transition, heading order, official programme link, About-to-Projects action, project action labels and theme persistence were checked. No document overflow, broken images or browser errors/warnings were found. The nineteen-route export checks also verify the new copy and retained original About introduction. Navigation, calendar and reduced-motion checks below were performed in the initial implementation and remain applicable to the unchanged components.

## Checks performed

- `npm run build` passed with the design policy, TypeScript checks, 25 exported routes and 21 legacy redirect stubs. Local Node: 24.19.0. The implementation commit `b64d70c` also passed the [Node 20 Linux PR build](https://github.com/Cambridge-AI-Build-Club/Cambridge-AI-Build-Club.github.io/actions/runs/38069028222) in 46 seconds.
- Fresh full-page screenshots inspected for About and Projects at 1440px and 375px in Warm Paper and Charcoal. Additional intermediate/breakpoint checks at 903px, 1100px and 1101px. Navigation clears the logo and appearance control immediately above the menu breakpoint.
- No horizontal document overflow or broken images in the checked views. Screenshot renders at its original 1280x720 ratio in both pages and themes. The delivered image is byte-identical to the source capture, 83,376 bytes; its loading and bytes were verified through the local server.
- Header destinations, active-page state, About footer link and project live/source/internal links checked. Project external actions use `noopener noreferrer`; no iframe or WebGL app is loaded on the club pages.
- Keyboard Enter opens the menu; Escape from a menu link closes it and returns visible focus to the toggle. Menu navigation to Projects closes the menu. Project action keyboard focus shows a visible outline and the Morphicons arrow state. Reduced-motion emulation suppresses CSS action transitions and shared UI SVGs remain Morphicons.
- Appearance choice survives page navigation and reloads. Home and Calendar smoke checks passed at the intermediate menu layout; calendar month navigation and session selection update matching details.
- Eight axe-core 4.14.0 scans (About/Projects, desktop/mobile, both themes; WCAG 2 A/AA and 2.1 AA tags) found zero violations and zero incomplete findings. The temporary scan library was removed from each page after the scan; it is not a production dependency. These targeted scans accompany visual and keyboard review, rather than establish a full accessibility certification.
- Nineteen production HTML routes returned HTTP 200 with one h1 each. Projects canonical metadata, sitemap entry and `/CUABC-Web/projects/` redirect checked. Browser log collection found no errors or warnings during the reviewed navigation. `git diff --check` passed.

## Screenshot provenance and URL comparison

The project image is a real screenshot captured on 10 October 2026 from https://cambridge-ai-build-club.github.io/CBC-World/. The original capture and research evidence remain outside the repository in the current chat's `about-projects-research` folder. Its global map counts are shown only as part of the documentary screenshot and are not used as club membership figures.

Both supplied URLs returned byte-identical 2,087-byte HTML (SHA-256 `309582943b05a6f82bafdd328e72163d57d6a25bcc63941c833f518c933cf9a7`) and loaded the same JavaScript/CSS. No query-version switch exists in the reviewed application source. The plain URL is declared in its Open Graph metadata and is used for the new links.

## Publication boundary

A plan approval authorised implementation and this local review build. It did not approve the completed site preview for merge. The pull request stays open until local review approval and a passing PR build; publication/deployment checks have not yet been performed. The legacy Jekyll rollback was not built in this change.
