# Progress

> Archived task snapshot. Its local state and pending actions are historical. PR #17 is merged; see the [reconciled release ledger](../../../README.md#release-ledger) and [current contributor rules](../../../../AGENTS.md). Historical branch names predate the current Conventional Branch rule and must not be reused as examples.

- Inspected main baseline, source pictograms and official Morphicons documentation.
- Created dedicated branch without touching user-owned .zcode/.
- Created DESIGN.md before UI edits, with a maintenance-first protocol, concrete approved rules and a pending verification record.

- Installed exact morphicons 1.7.1 and lucide 1.52.0; checked installed props/SSR implementation against official guidance.
- Added the shared Icon component, changed every UI pictogram in production/playground, and wired parent hover/focus plus state-driven transitions.
- Added AGENTS.md maintenance instructions and a prebuild policy guard. The initial ASCII guard false-positive on a date separator was corrected before rebuilding.
- Configured the PR contract guard and verified both acceptance and rejection cases locally.
- Final build passed: 24 static pages and 20 legacy redirects. Audited 182 server-rendered Morphicons across 19 routes and preserved calendar/content integrity.
- Verified real SVG morphing, parent keyboard focus, theme/menu/calendar controls and reduced motion. Reviewed fresh desktop/mobile screenshots and targeted accessibility results.
- Updated DESIGN.md with completed verification, saved a durable QA report and representative screenshots, and kept the port 4102 preview running. No commit, PR or publication performed for this local design iteration.
- Applied the owner's four browser comments after updating DESIGN.md first. Final build and Home/Calendar/Community reviews at 1440px, 903px and 375px passed.
- Owner authorized PR creation and merging after preview review. Preparing the publication with remote checks and deployment verification; .zcode/ remains excluded.
